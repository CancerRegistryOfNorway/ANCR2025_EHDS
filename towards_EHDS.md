# Intro

Significant opportunities exist to strengthen the Nordics countries position as leaders in
cancer data utilisation, particularly in light of the forthcoming European Health Data Space
(EHDS). The EHDS defines several roles relevant for cancer registries and researchers:

* Health Data Holders, and Trusted Data Holders (TDHs)
* Health Data Users
* Health Data Access Body (HDAB)
* Secure Processing Environments (SPEs)

TDHs often host their own SPEs and national HDABs may delegate some responsibilities to TDHs.  

# Towards the European Health Data Space (EHDS)

* The EHDS is part of the broader EU Data Strategy, which seeks to create interconnected European
data spaces across strategic fields, including health. These data spaces are designed to promote
the responsible and secure use of data while improving collaboration and accessibility for societal
benefit.

Key Components of the EHDS:

1. Primary use (use of data for the delivery of healthcare)
2. Requirements for electronic health record (EHR) systems (Xt-EHR)
3. Secondary use (use of data for research and public interest purposes)

# EU legislation

* The EHDS regulation (26 March 2025) aims to establish a common framework for the use and exchange of electronic health data across the EU. The EHDS builds on GDPR, Data Governance Act,
Data Act, Network and Information Systems Directive.

* Provisions will be implemented in stages

* 2027: Deadline for the Commission to adopt several key implementing acts
* 2029: Implementation of the first set of cross-border functionalities, including access to patient summaries, e-prescriptions, and electronic dispensations.
* 2031: Expansion to include additional data categories, such as medical images and lab results.
* 2034: Secondary use provisions will apply to data from third countries and international organizations .

Most of the obligations will only start applying 4 years after the entry into force of the regulation.

# EHDS development of guidelines and technical specifications

## Secondary Use

* Common European rules and infrastructure
* National Health Data Access bodies (HDAB)
* Data catalogues available via HealthData@EU using HealthDCAT-AP
* Secure processing environments (SPE)
* Data holders (like Cancer Registries)
* Data users (researchers, …)

## Infrastructure, concrete

* Secure Processing Environments (SPE) are a cornerstone of the EHDS infrastructure

An SPE is a secure digital workspace where authorised users can process electronic
health data in a highly controlled manner

An SPE must meet at least the following core criteria:

* Data security: Prevent unauthorised access, maintain confidentiality, and ensure
data integrity.
* Restricted access: Allow users to process only those data covered by a valid data
permit, and only within the permitted scope.
* Controlled outputs: Ensure that only non-personal data—that is, aggregated and
anonymised results—can be exported, and only after authorisation by the
competent HDAB.

SPE may be used by data users, or HDAB.  Only anonymised, aggregate outputs may leave the environment, and only after validation.

## TEHDAS2 Towards the European Health Data Space  

The TEHDAS2 EU4Health Joint Action project started on 1 May 2024 and will end on 31 December 2026.

* 29 European countries, co-ordinated by the Finnish Innovation Fund, Sitra  
* develops common guidelines and technical specifications

### Work packages

The project is divided into eight work packages (WP). WP 1–3 are linked to execution of the joint action and WP 4–8 are thematic work packages linked to the secondary use of health data:

4. Collaboration models: Facilitates organisational implementation of HDABs.  
5. Data discovery: Establishes guidance for data holders and HDABs on data enrichment capabilities.
6. Access to data: Provides guideline for data users on good application and access practice as well as guideline for HDABs on the procedures and formats for data access.
7. Safe and secure processing: Gives clear guidelines and technical specifications about Secure Processing Environments (SPEs) and de-identification of data.
8. Serving citizens: Provides guidelines for HDABs to inform citizens and involve them in the understanding of how their health data is utilised and for which secondary use purpose.

### TEHDAS2 activities

## VALO (Value from Nordic Health Data)

The Nordic Council of Ministers launched the VALO (Value from Nordic Health Data) project, which aims to establish common principles for the implementation of the European Health Data Space regulation, and to explore ways to make the most of the opportunities offered by Nordic cooperation.  VALO started in February 2024 and is due to end in October 2025. A follow-up project will run partly in parallel from April 2025 to October 2026.

### VALO main objectives

* to strengthen Nordic cooperation and the use of health data in research, development and innovation
* to jointly prepare for the European Health Data Space by starting to implement changes and reforms and sharing best practices
* to test in practice and demonstrate the effectiveness of cross-border Nordic cooperation in the use of health data
* to achieve and maintain Nordic leadership in the secondary use of health data

### VALO results

* a Nordic cooperation model for the secondary use of health data.
* a Nordic EHDS2 Competence forum for coordinating the preparation and implementation of EHDS.
* piloting research based on federated analysis.

The Value from Nordic Health Data (VALO) forum, held on 20 May 2024

At the forum, Åslaug Helland, professor at the University of Oslo and Susanna Flaherty, healthcare director and country manager of IQVIA Finland, presented initial results of a VALO pilot study that compares the quality of patient care by analysing existing oncology data using Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) data model. Data will derive from three hospitals in Denmark, Finland and Norway.

### VALO Nordic Health Data Summit 30 October 2025

Presents result from VALO, and first results from the four-year FinHITS project, a four-year project
run by the Finnish Social and Health Data Permit Authority (Findata) to strengthen Finnish Health Data ICT for Secondary Use.

A GAP analysis related to SPEs (WP5 and WP6) has been published. This involved the NORTRE group;
TSD (University of Oslo), HUNT Cloud (NTNU) and SAFE (University of Bergen).  

* Information security management system
* Access management
* Data export
* Data import
* Functional requirements

And a consultation on SPUHIN SPE is open to October 18.

The director of CNR act as member of the SPUHIN project board.

* QUANTUM: metadata for quality and utility of datasets.(WP1–4 Siri Larønningen, WP3 Gintaras Pikelis)

## QUANTUM Project

The QUANTUM project (2024-2026) aims to create a common label system and tool to assess quality and utility of secondary use datasets and the maturity of the data holder responsible for each dataset. The labels are to be presented as metadata at HealthData@EU to enable data users (like researchers, policymakers, healthcare professionals) to identify data fit for their purpose.

### challenges

* self-assessment of quality labels
* no detailed quality description on variable level, only general quality measures.

* JA CancerWatch

Main goal:  timely data to ECIS (JRC)

Also, guide Cancer Registries to meet the requirements of the emerging EHDS, especially on:

* Prepare metadata catalogue (DCAT-AP) for the cancer registries
* Design the access to European Cancer Registry data via the HDAB structure – will each national HDAB work with the national registries, or will we offer European registry data as-a-whole?
* Create data quality labels for the cancer registries
* Analyse and expand mechanisms to do linkages with European cancer registries, via EHDS mechanisms

Detailed goals:

1. Support the sustainability and further digitisation of cancer registration across Europe.
2. Identify opportunities for more timely capture of rich, high-quality cancer registry data.
3. Identify opportunities for possible expansion of geographic coverage.
4. Improve key indicators in ECIS and create a roadmap for its expansion through new, impactful cancer registry data-driven indicators.
5. Develop technical solutions that ensure that aggregate high-quality data can be included in ECIS, and meet the requirements of the emerging EHDS infrastructure.

* UnCan European Federated Cancer Research data hub. (possibly NIPH-CRN)

# Challenges

* costs
* bureaucracy
* actual funding vs expectations
* large variation in technical maturity and resources between countries
* CoP 2024: low participation and stakeholder engagement within SG3 (SPE)
* EU vs national legislation?
* High expectations on HDAB role
* costs of user adaptation to rules and practices, application processes and use of SPE.
* lack of focus on federated analysis, and use of synthetic data.
* true national/european data sovereignty (currently deep dependencies on US-firm's cloud infrastructure)
* possible future reduction in the high level of trust and willingness to share personal health data
